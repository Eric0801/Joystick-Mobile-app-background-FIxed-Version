- There's a subfolder inside once you click into the first folder.
- The index.html and joy.js outside the /public directory perform the functions of a joystick remote connection.
- Upon running the project, ensure you run the command in terminal
  ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
 , as well as running index.html by connecting to the server IP.

If errors occur in your terminal or the node server.js command is not runnable after execution, please try the following steps, 
1. Verify your file path and ensure you access the correct directory.
2. Check that the server IP written in the code fits your local network IP.
